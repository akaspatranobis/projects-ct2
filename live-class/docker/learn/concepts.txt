Dockerfile
A
Dockerfile is a text document that contains all the commands a user could call on the command line to
assemble an image. Using the docker build, users can create an automated build that executes several
command line instructions in succession.

It depends on some predefined Keywords that has a significant meaning defined by Docker for creating Docker applications

FROM --> The
FROM keyword is used to define the base image, on which we
will be building. (FROM ubuntu:latest)

ADD
The
ADD keyword is used to add files to the container being built. The
syntax used is:
ADD <source> <destination in container> { also work for remote place and download it}

COPY 
COPY  <source> <destination in container> { no remote download}

RUN
The
RUN keyword is used to add layers to the base image,
by installing components. Each RUN statement adds a
new layer to the docker image. 
RUN apt-get update

ENV
The
ENV keyword is used to define environment variables
in the container runtime.

CMD
The
CMD keyword is used to run commands on the start of the
container. These commands run only when there is no argument
specified while running the container.
